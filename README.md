# PyGame Drum Kit Using the Ion Drum Rocker

An experiment using PyGame make a drum kit, to explore how to turn the game-controller style drum kit into a set of electronic drums with custom sounds.

It's been a while since I've played Rockband on the Xbox 360, I made this to see if I could get some use out of my [Ion Drum Rocker](https://www.ionaudio.com/products/details/drum-rocker-core-xbox-360) that's been gathering dust.

A side benefit of this script: it could be changed to map to different game controllers and trigger any sound.

Note and thanks: this project uses a pygame grew out of playing with "joystick_calls.py" much of the example's structure remains:

Also thanks: this script uses drum sounds from the awesome Sonic Pi project:
